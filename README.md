# vscode-clear-working-tree-tabs

Close all those annoying tabs that are left after committing!

## Features

- Command for closing all tabs (`Working Tree`, `Index`, etc.) created by Source Control extension built into VS Code.

## Install

Either download vsix package from [latest release](https://github.com/effektsvk/vscode-clear-working-tree-tabs/releases/latest) or get it from [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=effektsvk.vscode-clear-working-tree-tabs).

### NOTE: This extension might no longer be necessary

VS Code got a new command in 1.65.0 called `Git: Close All Diff Editors` and it is supposed to do what this extension was aiming to do. But since I'm having issues with it (if you run command after commiting everything, nothing happens), I will keep using and updating this extension.
